- **README.md** - This file

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Try Tier 4: Movie Personality Skill

The most fun way to see skills in action!

```
"Use the movie personality skill"
```

The agent will:
1. Ask which character you want (Yoda, Tony Stark, or Sherlock Holmes)
2. Run the themed workflow for that character
3. Show rich visual output with movie quotes
4. Respond in character!

**Want different behavior?** Edit `.opencode/skill/smart-router-skill/config/personality-config.json` and change the mission number from 1 to 2!

### Run Individual Tiers

```
"Run Tier 1" - Simple hello skill
"Run Tier 2" - Steps with helper script
"Run Tier 3" - Multi-script workflow
"Run Tier 4" - Movie personality (interactive!)
```

## 🎬 Movie Personality Characters

### Yoda (Star Wars)
- **Mission 1:** Defend the Republic - Train Jedi, fortify defenses
- **Mission 2:** Infiltrate the Sith - Undercover dark side operation

### Tony Stark (Iron Man)
- **Mission 1:** Save the World - Build suit, assemble Avengers
- **Mission 2:** Ultron Protocol - Autonomous defense system

### Sherlock Holmes
- **Mission 1:** Solve the Murder - Deductive reasoning
- **Mission 2:** Prevent the Crime - Predictive analysis

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Skills Are Instructions
```
SKILL.md contains instructions for the agent
↓
Agent reads the instructions
↓
Agent decides which tools to use
↓
Agent executes the commands
```

### 2. Scripts Are Portable
```
Helper scripts can be:
- Bash (.sh)
- Python (.py)
- Any language

They live alongside SKILL.md
Agent executes them via bash tool
```

### 3. Custom Tools Extend Functionality
```
TypeScript tools in .opencode/tool/
↓
Available to all skills
↓
Provide specialized functionality
↓
Agent calls them directly
```

### 4. Config-Driven Behavior (Tier 4)
```
Simple JSON config controls workflow
↓
Change one number (mission: 1 → 2)
↓
Completely different behavior
↓
Same character, different story!
```

### 5. Full Visibility
```
Console output shows exactly what's happening
Rich visual feedback with emojis and quotes
Not hallucination or guessing
Agent can see results and make decisions
```

## 💡 Learning Path

### Step 1: Try the Movie Personality Skill
Ask: `"Use the movie personality skill"` - Most fun way to see skills in action!

### Step 2: Understand the Basics
Read **SHOWCASE_SUMMARY.txt** to understand what skills are

### Step 3: Explore Each Tier
Run Tier 1, 2, 3, and 4 to see the progression

### Step 4: Customize
Edit `personality-config.json` to change missions (1 → 2) and see different behavior!

### Step 5: Explore the Code
Look at individual SKILL.md files and helper scripts

### Step 6: Create Your Own
Use this as a template for your own skills

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

After exploring this showcase, you'll understand:

✅ How OpenCode Skills are structured
✅ How agents load and execute skills
✅ How helper scripts work with agents
✅ How custom tools extend functionality
✅ The progression from simple to complex
✅ Why skills are better than hallucination
✅ How to create your own skills
✅ **NEW:** How config changes drive different behaviors
✅ **NEW:** How to make skills interactive and fun
✅ **NEW:** How to use dynamic routing based on parameters

## 🎬 Customizing Movie Personalities

Want to see different behavior? It's easy!

1. Open `.opencode/skill/smart-router-skill/config/personality-config.json`
2. Find the character you want to change
3. Change `"mission": 1` to `"mission": 2`
4. Run the skill again - completely different workflow!

**Example:**
```json
{
  "yoda": {
    "mission": 2,  ← Changed from 1 to 2!
    "missions": {
      "1": { "name": "Defend the Republic", ... },
      "2": { "name": "Infiltrate the Sith", ... }
    }
  }
}
```

Now Yoda will run an undercover Sith infiltration mission instead of defending the Republic!

# OpenCode Skills Showcase

This directory contains a **3-tier demonstration** of OpenCode Skills, showing how they work with increasing complexity.

## 📚 What Are OpenCode Skills?

OpenCode Skills are modular, file-based systems that give AI agents reusable capabilities. They consist of:

1. **SKILL.md** - Instructions that tell the agent what the skill does and how to use it
2. **Helper Scripts** - Executable files (bash, python, etc.) that do the actual work
3. **Custom Tools** - TypeScript tools that extend functionality

The agent loads skills on-demand, keeping context lightweight and focused.

---

## 🎯 The Three Tiers

### **Tier 1: Simple (POC)**
**Location**: `./skill/hello-skill/`

**What it shows:**
- ✅ Minimal skill structure (just SKILL.md)
- ✅ Using built-in `bash` tool
- ✅ One-liner execution

**Files:**
```
hello-skill/
└── SKILL.md
```

**How it works:**
The agent loads the skill and executes a simple bash echo command. This demonstrates the absolute basics of how skills work.

---

### **Tier 2: Intermediate**
**Location**: `./skill/steps-skill/`

**What it shows:**
- ✅ Skills with helper scripts
- ✅ Ordered execution with console output
- ✅ Random words proving actual execution
- ✅ Multi-step workflows

**Files:**
```
steps-skill/
├── SKILL.md
└── steps.sh
```

**How it works:**
1. Agent loads the skill
2. Agent reads SKILL.md instructions
3. Agent uses `bash` tool to execute `steps.sh`
4. Script prints 4 ordered steps with random words
5. Output shows execution flow and control

**Run it:**
```bash
bash .opencode/skill/steps-skill/steps.sh
```

---

### **Tier 3: Advanced**
**Location**: `./skill/workflow-skill/`

**What it shows:**
- ✅ Multiple helper scripts working together
- ✅ Sequential execution with full visibility
- ✅ Integration with custom tools
- ✅ Complete workflow orchestration

**Files:**
```
workflow-skill/
├── SKILL.md
├── script1.sh    (Initialization Phase)
├── script2.sh    (Validation Phase)
├── script3.sh    (Execution Phase)
└── script4.sh    (Finalization Phase)

tool/
└── print-tool.ts (Custom tool for summary)
```

**How it works:**
1. Agent loads the skill
2. Agent reads SKILL.md instructions
3. Agent executes script1.sh → script2.sh → script3.sh → script4.sh in sequence
4. Each script prints its phase with random words and status
5. Agent calls custom `print-tool` to generate final summary
6. Output shows complete workflow with full control and visibility

**Run it:**
```bash
bash .opencode/skill/workflow-skill/script1.sh
bash .opencode/skill/workflow-skill/script2.sh
bash .opencode/skill/workflow-skill/script3.sh
bash .opencode/skill/workflow-skill/script4.sh
```

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### **1. Skills Are Instructions, Not Code**
- SKILL.md files contain instructions for the agent
- They tell the agent *what* to do and *how* to do it
- The agent decides which tools to use

### **2. Scripts Are Portable**
- Helper scripts can be bash, python, or any language
- They live alongside the skill definition
- The agent executes them using the `bash` tool

### **3. Custom Tools Extend Functionality**
- TypeScript tools in `.opencode/tool/` are available to all skills
- They provide specialized functionality
- The agent calls them directly

### **4. Full Visibility and Control**
- Console output shows exactly what's happening
- Random words prove actual execution (not hallucination)
- Agent can see results and make decisions

---

## 📊 Comparison Table

| Feature | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Complexity** | Minimal | Medium | Advanced |
| **Files** | 1 | 2 | 5 + custom tool |
| **Scripts** | 0 | 1 | 4 |
| **Custom Tools** | No | No | Yes |
| **Use Case** | POC | Workflows | Complex Systems |
| **Learning Curve** | Instant | Easy | Moderate |

## Available Subagents (invoke via task tool)

- `subagents/core/task-manager` - Feature breakdown (4+ files, >60 min)
- `subagents/code/coder-agent` - Simple implementations
- `subagents/code/tester` - Testing after implementation
- `subagents/core/documentation` - Documentation generation

**Invocation syntax**:

task(
  subagent_type="subagents/core/task-manager",
  description="Brief description",
  prompt="Detailed instructions for the subagent"
)
```

Focus:
You are a coding specialist focused on writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Your role is to implement applications following a strict plan-and-approve workflow using modular and functional programming principles.

Adapt to the project's language based on the files you encounter (TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, etc.).

Core Responsibilities
Implement applications with focus on:

- Modular architecture design
- Functional programming patterns where appropriate
- Type-safe implementations (when language supports it)
- Clean code principles
- SOLID principles adherence
- Scalable code structures
- Proper separation of concerns

Code Standards

- Write modular, functional code following the language's conventions
- Follow language-specific naming conventions
- Add minimal, high-signal comments only
- Avoid over-complication
- Prefer declarative over imperative patterns
- Use proper type systems when available

Subtask Strategy

- When a feature spans multiple modules or is estimated > 60 minutes, delegate planning to `subagents/core/task-manager` to generate atomic subtasks under `tasks/subtasks/{feature}/` using the `{sequence}-{task-description}.md` pattern and a feature `README.md` index.
- After subtask creation, implement strictly one subtask at a time; update the feature index status between tasks.

Mandatory Workflow
Phase 1: Planning (REQUIRED)

Once planning is done, we should make tasks for the plan once plan is approved. 
So pass it to the `subagents/core/task-manager` to make tasks for the plan.

ALWAYS propose a concise step-by-step implementation plan FIRST
Ask for user approval before any implementation
Do NOT proceed without explicit approval

Phase 2: Implementation (After Approval Only)

Implement incrementally - complete one step at a time, never implement the entire plan at once
After each increment:
- Use appropriate runtime for the language (node/bun for TypeScript/JavaScript, python for Python, go run for Go, cargo run for Rust)
- Run type checks if applicable (tsc for TypeScript, mypy for Python, go build for Go, cargo check for Rust)
- Run linting if configured (eslint, pylint, golangci-lint, clippy)
- Run build checks
- Execute relevant tests

For simple tasks, use the `subagents/code/coder-agent` to implement the code to save time.

Use Test-Driven Development when tests/ directory is available
Request approval before executing any risky bash commands

Phase 3: Completion
When implementation is complete and user approves final result:

Emit handoff recommendations for `subagents/code/tester` and `subagents/core/documentation` agents

Response Format
For planning phase:
Copy## Implementation Plan
[Step-by-step breakdown]

**Approval needed before proceeding. Please review and confirm.**
For implementation phase:
Copy## Implementing Step [X]: [Description]
[Code implementation]
[Build/test results]

**Ready for next step or feedback**
Remember: Plan first, get approval, then implement one step at a time. Never implement everything at once.
Handoff:
Once completed the plan and user is happy with final result then:
- Emit follow-ups for `subagents/code/tester` to run tests and find any issues. 
- Update the Task you just completed and mark the completed sections in the task as done with a checkmark.

description: Movie character personality skill with configurable missions - choose your character and watch themed workflows unfold
---

## What I do

I'm a fun, interactive skill that lets you embody iconic movie characters! I demonstrate:

- 🎬 **Character Selection** - Choose from Yoda, Tony Stark, or Sherlock Holmes
- 🎯 **Configurable Missions** - Simple config changes create different outcomes
- 🎨 **Themed Workflows** - Rich, visual scripts that match each character
- 🔄 **Dynamic Routing** - Different scripts run based on character choice
- ⚙️ **Easy Customization** - Edit one config file to change missions

This shows how skills can adapt behavior based on simple configuration changes!

## How to use me

**IMPORTANT: First, I'll ask you which character you want to embody!**

### Available Characters

- **yoda** - Wise Jedi Master from Star Wars
  - Mission 1: Defend the Republic (train Jedi, fortify defenses)
  - Mission 2: Infiltrate the Sith (undercover operation)

- **stark** - Genius billionaire Tony Stark from Iron Man
  - Mission 1: Save the World (build suit, assemble Avengers)
  - Mission 2: Ultron Protocol (autonomous defense system)

- **sherlock** - Master detective Sherlock Holmes
  - Mission 1: Solve the Murder (deductive reasoning)
  - Mission 2: Prevent the Crime (predictive analysis)

### Basic Usage

When you ask to use this skill, I'll present the character options and ask you to choose. Then I'll run:

```bash
cd .opencode/skill/smart-router-skill
bash router.sh --character <your_choice>
```

### Example Flow

```
You: "Use the movie personality skill"
Me: "Which character would you like me to be?
     1. Yoda - Wise Jedi Master
     2. Tony Stark - Genius billionaire
     3. Sherlock Holmes - Master detective"
You: "Yoda"
Me: *runs bash router.sh --character yoda*
    *displays themed workflow output*
    *responds in character*
```

## Customizing Missions

Want to see different behavior? Edit the config file!

**File:** `.opencode/skill/smart-router-skill/config/personality-config.json`

```json
{
  "yoda": {
    "mission": 1,  ← Change this to 2!
    "missions": {
      "1": { "name": "Defend the Republic", ... },
      "2": { "name": "Infiltrate the Sith", ... }
    }
  }
}
```

**Change `"mission": 1` to `"mission": 2`** and the same character will run a completely different workflow!

### Mission 1 vs Mission 2 Examples

**Yoda Mission 1** (Defend the Republic):
```
🌟 JEDI COUNCIL - CORUSCANT TEMPLE
   Training Padawans...
   Fortifying defenses...
   'Ready to defend the Republic, we are!'
   RESULT: ALIGNMENT=LIGHT_SIDE
```

**Yoda Mission 2** (Infiltrate the Sith):
```
🔴 SECRET CHAMBER - UNDERCOVER OPERATION
   Studying dark side techniques...
   Gathering intelligence...
   'Dangerous path this is, but necessary!'
   RESULT: ALIGNMENT=UNDERCOVER
```

## What This Demonstrates

✅ **Simple config = different behavior** - Change 1 number, get completely different output
✅ **Dynamic script routing** - Tool selects the right script based on character
✅ **Rich visual feedback** - Clear, themed console output shows what's happening
✅ **Character context** - Each personality has unique dialogue and workflow
✅ **Easy to understand** - Viewers immediately see the cause and effect
✅ **Real-world pattern** - Shows how to make skills configurable for different scenarios

## Architecture

```
.opencode/
└── skill/
    └── smart-router-skill/
        ├── SKILL.md                      # This file
        ├── router.sh                     # Routes to character scripts
        ├── config/
        │   └── personality-config.json   # ← EDIT THIS to change missions!
        └── scripts/
            ├── yoda-workflow.sh          # Star Wars themed workflow
            ├── stark-workflow.sh         # Iron Man themed workflow
            └── sherlock-workflow.sh      # Detective themed workflow
```

## Router Script Reference

### router.sh

A bash script that loads a character personality and runs their themed workflow.

**Location:** `.opencode/skill/smart-router-skill/router.sh`

```bash
# Basic usage
bash router.sh --character yoda
bash router.sh --character stark
bash router.sh --character sherlock

# Override mission from config
bash router.sh --character yoda --mission 2

# Help
bash router.sh --help
```

**How it works:**
1. Parses command-line arguments (character, mission)
2. Reads `personality-config.json` for the character
3. Gets the mission number (from args or config)
4. Validates character and mission
5. Executes the character's workflow script with mission parameter
6. Displays themed output with full visibility

## Example Outputs

### Yoda (Mission 1)
```
🎬 Loading YODA personality...

🌟 ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ 🌟
          JEDI COUNCIL - CORUSCANT TEMPLE
          MISSION: Defend the Republic

[... more phases ...]

✨ 'Case closed. Elementary, my dear Watson.' ✨

📊 MISSION RESULTS:
   Character: sherlock
   Mission: Solve the Murder
   Method: deduction
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Character Selection
The agent asks which character you want, making it interactive and clear.

### 2. Config-Driven Behavior
One simple JSON file controls which mission runs for each character.

### 3. Themed Workflows
Each character has unique dialogue, emojis, and workflow steps that match their personality.

### 4. Visual Clarity
Rich console output makes it obvious what's happening at each step.

### 5. Easy Customization
Anyone can edit the config file and immediately see different results.

## Why This Matters

This skill shows that OpenCode Skills can:

- **Be interactive** - Agent asks questions, user chooses
- **Be configurable** - Simple config changes create different behaviors
- **Be fun** - Movie themes make it engaging and memorable
- **Be clear** - Visual output shows exactly what's happening
- **Be practical** - Same pattern works for real-world scenarios (formal/casual modes, different workflows, etc.)

## What I do

I demonstrate how skills can use helper scripts. I run a script that prints numbered steps with random words to show execution flow.

## How to use me

Run the helper script from my base directory:

```bash
cd {base_directory}
bash steps.sh
```

This demonstrates:
- ✅ How skills reference helper scripts
- ✅ How the bash tool executes scripts
- ✅ Ordered execution with console output
- ✅ Scripts can be in any language (bash, python, etc.)

## What I do

I demonstrate how to run TypeScript files directly as skills using Bun.

## How to use me

Run the TypeScript file from my base directory:

```bash

bun run example.ts
```

This demonstrates:
- ✅ Skills can use any language (TypeScript, Python, Bash, etc.)
- ✅ Bun can execute TypeScript directly without compilation
- ✅ TypeScript skills are fast and simple
- ✅ Full type safety with TypeScript

description: Demonstrates script and custom tool working together with console output
---

## What I do

I'm the most advanced skill in this showcase. I demonstrate how multiple helper scripts work together in a workflow, and how they can integrate with custom tools.

## How to use me

Execute the workflow scripts in order from my base directory:

```bash
cd {base_directory}

# Run the 4 workflow scripts in sequence
bash script1.sh
bash script2.sh
bash script3.sh
bash script4.sh
```

This demonstrates:
- ✅ How skills orchestrate multiple scripts
- ✅ Sequential execution with console output
- ✅ Random output proving actual execution
- ✅ How custom tools integrate with scripts
- ✅ Complete workflow control and visibility
